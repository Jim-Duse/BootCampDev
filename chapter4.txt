Interest in Data Engineering Opportunities / Shadowing
Hi [Manager’s Name],
I hope you are doing well.
My name is Jimmy Dusengimana, and I currently work in the IT Support team. I recently had the opportunity to speak with [Data Engineer’s Name], and he encouraged me to reach out to you regarding my interest in the Data Engineering team.
Over the past year, I completed the IBM Data Engineering Professional Certificate through Coursera and have been building hands-on projects involving SQL, Python, ETL processes, and big data tools such as Spark and Hive. I have a strong interest in data pipelines, data architecture, and how data flows across systems to support business decisions.
I would be extremely grateful for any opportunity to learn from your team — whether through shadowing, assisting on small tasks, internship-style involvement, or any way I can contribute while continuing to grow my skills.
Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I would greatly appreciate the chance to speak with you further.
Kind regards,
Jimmy Dusengimana
